# RACE:GP

RACE:GP (Recommender systems: Automatic Creation and Evaluation using Genetic Programming) is a method that uses genetic programming to automatically generate and improve recommender systems on any dataset. This code is used to verify the hypotheses in the thesis:

RACE:GP -- a Generic Approach to Automatically Create and Evaluate Hybrid Recommender Systems

This repository contains two versions of the code, `v1`, and `v2`. v2 is used to produce the results found in the thesis, and the code used to produce and analyse the outputs in `process_results`. 

`git-lfs` is used to store all csv's and pdf's.
